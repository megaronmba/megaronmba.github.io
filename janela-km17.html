        <h6><i>In general, we recommend that the applicant ask his/her immediate supervisor for a letter. Some schools suggest (and we reinforce that) that in case that is not possible, the applicant use the “additional information” space provided on the data form or the optional essay to explain the reasons. The atypical dynamics of consulting projects somehow affects the concept of direct supervisor. Some schools make such request because they expect an immediate superior to be more prepared to reveal the values of the applicant. That is all. If you have been in a rather “unattractive” assignment in the past three months, don’t bother to pick a recommender from this specific project just because it is the most recent. If the assignment that best shows your skills and that highlights your “brand” ended in APRIL, ask the letter to the Associate/Manager/Partner with whom you worked in this project. Thus, you can choose a boss from an older assignment.</i></h6>

        <h6><i>Firstly, it is <u>possible</u> to apply without a letter from an immediate supervisor. Although that is not ideal, the Admission Committee members are sensitive to this kind of issue. Naturally, in this case, she should use your optional essay to explain why she cannot request a letter from someone who knows her so well. If she plans to request her immediate superior for a letter, do so from July onwards. At the moment, his awareness of her MBA plans would not actually help in anything; besides, if he is likely to get in the way of her process, he should definitely keep it to himself, at least for the time being.

        <h6><i>They are an important element in your application process. Good recommendations support and emphasize your application: they offer particular details on your work experience and success. They even fill in gaps or lessen weak points in your essays. Bad recommendations, on the other hand, may destroy the image you have devoted deeply to convey throughout your essays. Business schools request recommendation letters in order to check whether the information you provide in your essays and résumé is accurate. The admission committee may also seek information you may have (perhaps deliberately) omitted in your writing.</i></h6>
